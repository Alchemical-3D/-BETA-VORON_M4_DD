VORON M4 Conversion to Direct Drive for V6 Hotends

This is the first rendition of the VORON_M4_DIRECT_DRIVE. This system's initial design is based on the Voron M4 components.

The original design of this extruder belongs to VORON Design, please take a moment if you are not familiar with the Voron project to educate yourself on 
the hard work they commit to the makerspace. https://vorondesign.com/

This mod uses the same parts list as the original VORON M4, it is designed to offer a direct drive solution for users with a V6 (or clone) or Revo-Six
hotend.  However, while being designed specifically for those units, this extruder may work with any extruder using the same throat clamp solution.

For this mod you simply need to print the (3) parts which were modified instead of the originals during assembly.  

  1. VORON_M4_Assembly_parts_-_End_Plate_v1
  2. VORON_M4_Assembly_parts_-_Midsection_v1
  3. VORON_M4_Assembly parts - Motor Plate

When assembling this system, you will place the End_Plate_v1 part on the X carriage, assemble the rest seperate of it and attach after complete.  This is the only way to access all of the mounting locations.

An additional cooling solution has been provided that works with this system, but you are not limited to this cooling solution.  It is provided out of convenience for users.
